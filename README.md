# AntifragiCIty_KPIs_definition_framework
The AntifragiCity KPI selection uses a flexible, three-stage mixed-methods iterative approach.  The methodology defines, refines, & customizes KPIs based on strategic vision, objectives, & real-world applicability for urban mobility management. The methodology for KPI selection involves five steps: delineating strategic vision, establishing operational objectives, specifying requirements, systematically identifying and selecting KPIs from a comprehensive catalogue, and refining or extending the preliminary set. This approach combines criteria-based filtering, multi-criteria decision analysis, an ontology-driven backbone, and expert input.The API structure for the KPI definition tool is layered to facilitate seamless integration and real-time data exchange. It comprises:
- City Stakeholders: The final users of the API.
- API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for the software.
- KPI Service Layer: Handles selection logic and data processing.
- KPIs’ Catalogue Store: Responsible for persistent storage and retrieval of KPI definitions and associated metadata.
This structure also incorporates feedback loops to refine and validate KPIs, ensuring their continuous relevance and accuracy in monitoring urban dynamics.
